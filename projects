                <h2>Senior Thesis</h2>
                <p>
                    For my senior thesis, I am exploring the effects of artificial intelligence on computer science majors in secondary education.
                    As AI tools become increasingly integrated into education, there is a growing need to examine how they influence a student's learning process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research focuses on understanding whether the use of AI enhances problem-solving abilities or diminishes fundamental skills like critical thinking,
                    as AI often provides answers without teaching the underlying concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan to further research this topic in my Master’s program. As the use of AI continues to increase and literacy rates among young Americans decrease, 
                    it's crucial to study the long-term effects of relying on chatbots for homework.

                <h2>Outreach Program</h2>
                <p>
                    I am in the process of starting a computer science outreach program for the 2025-2026 school year at my local high school. My high school has a robotics team so
					the two programs would complement each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My primary goal is to introduce students to coding, networks, and database systems, bridging the learning gap for an ‘intimidating’ major. This program aims
                    to encourage more students to pursue computer science by providing exposure and guidance.
                </p>
				<p> I would love to give back to my community and inspire more girls to pursue this field as it can be rather intimidating to really consider a male-dominated field at a young age.
				Tutoring at IUN has made me realize that there is a want in regard to learning about computer science; however, the learning curve is incredibly steep for those who have not been exposed
				to it. </p>
